The motivation of the project was to automate the detection of pneumatic lung using its X-ray image during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its a CNN model developed in Python using Keras and tensorflow. The model has a decent accuracy of 90 percent. For better accessibility, a web app was developed using streamlit where the users can simply upload the X-ray images and get the prediction.
